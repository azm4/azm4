# About

*I am a CSE Major in **Bangladesh*** currently studying at **United International University** in *United City, Dhaka, Bangladesh*


# Interests

My interests are diverse. *Systems, Programming, Philosophy, Psychology, Math, Faith, Purpose of life, and more*. Perhaps too many, but trying to bring an order to this chaos. Tackling one at a time. Now focusing more on *Academics and Tech*. In addition to that, *everything a 22 year old can be interested in*.


# What brings me to GitHub

Probably because all of my peers use it, and I was interested in *Linux* and my mentor suggested I should check *Github* out too. I like it here.


# Learning Path

| **Foundational** | **Technical** |
| --------------- |---------------|
| C/C++            | Linux CLI: Basic Commands |
| Mathematics      | Git/Github |
| Regular Problem Solving | Python|

These are my first steps. As I am creating this `README.md` file, I already became friendly with **Markdown**. I love it. Wish to complete them gradually and possibly move on to the next chapter. 


# Books & Resources regarding My Path

Will be added soon.


# A Glimps of Me

- To me, **A programmer is one who breaks down every problem into manageable steps**.
- I prefer **Documentation** over Videos.
- I don't like to stare at screens all the time. 
- I prefer Discipline and Strive to achieve it.
  

# External Links 

Will be added soon.


# Notable Skills

None, yet. But I wish to build some soon.


# Looking Forward

I am excited of what will come next. Feel free to reach out or explore my projects. If you have any projects that I fit into, please connect, I would love to collaborate.
